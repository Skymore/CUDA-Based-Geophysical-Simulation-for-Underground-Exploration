# Accelerating Three-Dimensional FDTD Wavefield Propagation and Reverse Time Imaging
## Using CUDA Parallel Programming
## Focused on improving the time efficiency of 3D FDTD modeling and reverse time imaging by refactoring the most time-consuming wavefield extension process in Matlab to CUDA.
## Achieved approximately 40 times faster performance compared to CPU serial programming.
